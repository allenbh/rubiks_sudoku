"Our markets, our democracy, our science, our traditions of free speech, and
our art all depend more heavily on a Public Domain of freely available material
than they do on the informational material that is covered by property rights.
The Public Domain is not some gummy residue left behind when all the good stuff
has been covered by property law. The Public Domain is the place we quarry the
building blocks of our culture. It is, in fact, the majority of our culture."
(James Boyle, The Public Domain, p.40f, 2008)
